Introduction\\nExplaining observed phenomena through symbolic, inter-\\npretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. From\\nKepler’s laws to the Navier–Stokes equations, many major\\ndiscoveries can be viewed as instances of “equation dis-\\ncovery”: given observations of a system, infer a compact\\nmathematical expression that captures its underlying struc-\\nture and dynamics. Symbolic regression (SR) including\\nevolutionary search (Schmidt & Lipson, 2009) and sparse\\nregression (Brunton et al., 2016) formalizes this problem as\\na search over symbolic expressions, aiming to find formulas\\nthat both fit the data and are interpretable. This makes SR an\\nattractive tool for scientific discovery, where interpretability\\n1UCSD.

To obtain a correct and interpretable\\nequation, a practitioner must make many intertwined design\\nchoices: the function library (polynomial degree, inclusion\\nof rational or transcendental functions), sparsity regulariza-\\ntion and thresholds, allowed mathematical operators, and\\nstopping criteria, etc. If the configuration is too restrictive\\n(e.g., a low-degree polynomial library), the true equation\\nmay be outside the hypothesis space and cannot be recov-\\nered. If it is too expressive (e.g., a very rich function set\\nwith a large number of operators), the hypothesis space be-\\ncomes enormous, making the equation search intractable.\\nIn practice, experts mitigate these issues by injecting prior\\nknowledge: dimensional analysis, symmetries, conserved\\nquantities, or qualitative behaviors such as saturation or\\nperiodicity. However, this requires deep domain expertise\\nand many manual iterations from configuring and running\\nto inspecting and refining, limiting the accessibility and\\nscalability of algorithmic SR-based equation discovery.\\nRecent works have shown that Large language models\\n(LLMs) can automate some of this laborious configuration\\nworkflow thanks to their broad scientific knowledge and\\nreasoning abilities. This has led to a new wave of LLM-\\nbased methods for discovering symbolic equations. For\\ninstance, LLM-SR (Shojaee et al., 2025a) represents equa-\\ntions as numerical programs and uses an LLM to synthesize\\nprogram “skeletons” that define candidate equation struc-\\ntures. These skeletons are then completed and refined via\\nevolutionary search and numerical optimization.

They use brute-force to map\\ndata to equations by iteratively scoring the LLM-proposed\\ncandidate expressions. Human scientists, on the contrary,\\nrarely jump straight from raw data to a final closed-form\\nequation. They first probe the system to uncover structural\\n',\n",
       " 'properties, such as symmetries, conserved quantities, di-\\nmensional constraints, etc. These properties are then used\\nto reshape the problem. Scientists choose variables, co-\\nordinates, and candidate function families that respect the\\nidentified structural constraints. Only after this process has\\nsubstantially narrowed the plausible hypothesis space do\\nthey search for specific equations and test them through\\nsimulation and extrapolation. Unfortunately, none of the\\nexisting LLM-based approaches follow the reasoning pro-\\ncess of human scientists and directly operate over these\\nintermediate steps. This makes the discovery process brittle\\nand opaque, and it underutilizes the rich domain knowledge\\nfrom a pretrained LLM and the wealth of physics-based\\nnumerical and algorithmic tools that can uncover structure\\nfrom data as additional inputs.\\nMoreover, current LLM-based evaluations (Shojaee et al.,\\n2025b) are still narrow in terms of experimental domains.\\nMany benchmarks focus on scalar algebraic relations or one-\\ndimensional ODEs, while comprehensive tests on richer dy-\\nnamical systems are rare, e.g., systems governed by coupled\\nODEs and PDEs. These systems often possess additional\\nphysical structure, such as spatial and phase-space sym-\\nmetries, conservation laws, etc. These properties provide\\npowerful levers for reducing the search space, and thus cre-\\nate a natural setting to test whether an LLM behaves more\\nlike a human scientist: first inferring and using such struc-\\nture to constrain hypotheses, rather than directly guessing\\nequations from data.\\nIn this work, rather than using LLMs as monolithic equation\\nguessers, we propose to use LLMs asagentsthat orchestrate\\nphysics-based tools to emulate the multi-step workflow used\\nby human scientists. We introduceKeplerAgent, a physics-\\nguided LLM agent framework for equation discovery. Given\\nobservational data from a system, an LLM agent can call\\ntools to estimate intermediate structure, such as candidate\\nsymmetries, relevant functional terms and operators, among\\nother constraints and patterns derived from data. The agent\\nthen translates these structural findings into concrete con-\\nfiguration decisions for symbolic regression tools such as\\nPySINDy (de Silva et al., 2020) and PySR (Cranmer, 2023).\\nBy interleaving these tool calls, the agent can refine both the\\nhypothesis space and candidate equations iteratively, which\\ncan be especially helpful when the naive search space is\\nintractably large.\\n',\n",

Empirically, Ke-\\nplerAgent recovers ground-truth equations more frequently\\nthan both direct LLM-based baselines and standalone SR\\ntools with standard configurations, and it produces models\\nthat better predict the target variables or future states of the\\nunderlying physical systems.\\nIn summary, our contributions are:\\n• Physics-guided agentic framework.

Related Works\\n2.1. Symbolic Regression\\nSymbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover an explicit sym-\\nbolic expression that maps inputs to outputs from data,\\nrather than learning a black-box predictor. Early SR sys-\\ntems are largely based on genetic programming (GP), which\\nevolves populations of expression trees under selection pres-\\nsure from a fitness objective (Schmidt & Lipson, 2009; Gau-\\ncel et al., 2014).
